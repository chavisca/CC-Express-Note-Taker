# CC-EXPRESS-NOTE-TAKER

## Description

This project is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of the express package and the ability to join a front end and back end to complete an application by saving and retrieving data from a JSON file.  
Furthermore, this project expands on server routing by means of GET, POST, and DELETE requests, the inclusion of middleware, and server file organization via routing and modularization.
